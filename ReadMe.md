# AdventureWorksLt Technical Task

### Task 1 - API
All of the files for the api can be found in *AdventureWorksLt.Api*

To access the swagger docs, run the api and go to *https://localhost:7126/swagger/index.html*

Framework:
- .NET6
- Entity Framework Core

If I were to improve this api, I would implement filtering into the api through the use of query properties.

### Task 2 - User Interface
All of the files for the api can be found in *AdventureWorksLt.Ui*

Before you are able to run this, you will need to run a npm install.

### Task 3 - Admin Interface
All of the files for the api can be found in *AdventureWorksLt.Ui*

Due to time constraints this is missing some features and is not as polished as I would like.

### Task 4 - Sql Scripts
All of the files for the api can be found in *SqlScripts*

### Task 5 - Unit Tests
All of the files for the api can be found in *AdventureWorksLt.Api/AdventureWorksLt.Api.Tests*

I only had time to implement the first controller method. Ideally there would be a test on all the controller, service, repository, and any extension methods / helper classes.
